        0.1.0 [14-Jul-2014 {First pass at a Mushing function. Limited scope:

        * Returns a string
        * Does not discern word structure e.g. for separate handling of
          words with numbers or symbols
        * Few special cases for minimizing space between two values
        * Uses MOLD and not MOLD/ALL
        * Does not replace Rebol words with their RebMu counterpart
        * NOT RIGOROUSLY TESTED}]
